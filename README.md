## Tips and trics
Psst... if you are checkout between branches do not discard your changes. On each stage branch [ stage-[0-9] ]is only README file with task description. I recomend [git stash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing).

Psst2... if you are stuck, do not hesitate to ask me :)

Psst3...  there are resolved tasks on some branches [ stage-[0-9]-solution ] to compare your solution to my, but please do not checkout to this branches until you are done with excercises
