# Hibernate - simple configuration - STAGE - 1

When you want to connect to database, you need database. So you need to install and run or only run database engine. For simplicity i choose h2 database engine. 

1. Download h2 database [here](http://www.h2database.com/html/download.html) (I recomend platform-independent zip file)

2. Start database in server mode. You need to remember your credidentials to this db :)

3. If you can log in to your db in server mode you are done with this stage, please `git checkout stage-2`
